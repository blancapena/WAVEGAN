## Overview

Wave-GAN leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically a Pix2Pix-inspired conditional GAN architecture, to predict complex nonlinear interactions between ocean waves and offshore structures. This approach provides a computationally efficient alternative to traditional physics-based simulations, enabling fast and accurate predictions for engineering applications.

This code implements the core image-to-image translation pipeline underlying Wave-GAN:

- Modified U-Net generator with skip connections  
- PatchGAN discriminator for local adversarial feedback  
- Combined L1 and adversarial losses for robust training  
- Data preprocessing with augmentation, normalization, and batching  
- Training loop with checkpointing and TensorBoard support
